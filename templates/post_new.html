<!-- • On the top line we inherit from our base template.
• Use HTML <form> tags with the POST method since we’re sending data. If we were
receiving data from a form, for example in a search box, we would use GET.
• Add a {% csrf_token %} which Django provides to protect our form from cross-site
scripting attacks. You should use it for all your Django forms.
• Then to output our form data we use {{ form.as_p }} which renders it within
paragraph <p> tags.
• Finally specify an input type of submit and assign it the value “Save”
